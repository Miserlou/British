The write-up on why I decided to create my own language can be found here:

Unicorn can handle variable assignments, user input, random method, conditional statements and loops.
 
Current capabilities of the language can be seen in guessing_game.uni : https://github.com/gulnara/unicorn/blob/master/guessing_game.uni

I am working on adding data structures and functions. You can try some of the functionality on the webapp I created to teach Unicorn programming language: http://www.unicorncode.com/
