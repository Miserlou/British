#parser only reads online in simple_text, if there is a brek between lines it breaks


# in arithmetic the parser doesn't recognize the ()
(2+1)*3


# ++ works as + 

#if the test file has an extra line at the end, the program breaks

#conditionals can have only 1 or stmt and must have otherwise

#can't concat print statements with variables
